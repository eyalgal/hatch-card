A sleek, modern, and highly customizable Lovelace card to control your Hatch Rest devices in Home Assistant. This card combines light and media player controls into a single, intuitive interface.

> This card was built for and tested with the **Hatch Rest+**. It may work with other Hatch products (like the Rest, Rest Mini, or Restore) if they are supported by the underlying Hatch integration, but functionality is not guaranteed. The card is also flexible enough to be used with other sound and light devices from different brands.

## **‚ú® Features**

* **All-in-One Control:** Manage your device's light and sound from a single, unified card.  
* **Sound-Only Mode:** The light entity is now optional, allowing the card to function as a dedicated media player controller.  
* **Persistent Sleep Timer:** Link to an `input_text` helper to create a timer that survives browser reloads and stays in sync across devices.  
* **Device-Specific Controls:** Native support for Toddler Lock, Clock Brightness, and Battery Level indicators (requires corresponding entities).  
* **Customizable Layouts & Controls:** Choose between `vertical` or `horizontal` layouts and re-order controls to build your perfect interface.  
* **Dynamic Backgrounds:** Set the card background to reflect the light's color, visually represent the volume level, or keep it standard.  
* **Full Action Support:** Supports standard Home Assistant `tap_action`, `hold_action`, and `double_tap_action`.  
* **Custom Icons & Photos:** Use dynamic icons that change with the sound, set your own static icon, or even use a photo for a personal touch.  
* **Easy Configuration:** Fully configurable through the Lovelace visual UI editor.  
* **Haptic Feedback:** Get optional tactile feedback on mobile devices when you interact with the card.
* **Volume Slider:** Add a volume slider to the expanded controls for finer volume adjustment.
* **Custom Controls Order:** You can now fully customize the order of expanded controls, including the new slider.
* **Improved Scene Actions:** Scenes now support transition times and better input handling.
* **Synchronized Timers Across Dashboards:** Timers are now fully synchronized. When using a `timer_entity`, the card saves both the countdown and the specific end-actions (light color, sound, etc.) to a central helper. Set a timer on any device, and all other cards will stay in sync.  
**Persistent & Intelligent Timer Actions:** The last used timer actions are now saved and become the default for the next timer, ensuring a consistent experience. The editor also reads this shared state, so your configuration is always transparent.

## **‚úÖ Requirements**

* **Home Assistant:** Version 2023.4 or newer.  
* **Hatch Integration (Optional):** For Hatch devices, the [Hatch Rest Integration](https://github.com/dahlb/ha_hatch) by `dahlb` is required.  
* For other devices, you just need a `media_player` entity.

## Use Cases & Examples

### Toddler "OK-to-Wake" Nap Timer

This config creates a timer for an afternoon nap. When the timer expires, the white noise turns off, and the light turns on to a soft green color, signaling to your child that it's okay to wake up.

<img width="400" alt="Toddler 'OK-to-Wake' Nap Timer" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5210a972-e4a2-4c28-bfa6-3909075ebced" />

```yaml
type: custom:hatch-card
light_entity: light.rest_plus
media_player_entity: media_player.rest_plus
name: Johnny's Hatch
show_expand_button: true
show_timer: true
timer_presets: [60, 90, 120]
timer_action_turn_off_light: false # Keep light on
timer_action_turn_off_media: true # Turn sound off
timer_action_light_color: 'green'
timer_action_light_brightness: 40
```

### Simple Vertical Sound Machine

A compact, vertical card perfect for a mobile dashboard. It focuses on the essential controls: turning on/off and adjusting volume.

<img width="230" alt="Simple Vertical Sound Machine" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46728d42-7520-45db-aa2a-9c7f7d64d83a" />

```yaml
type: custom:hatch-card
light_entity: light.rest_plus
media_player_entity: media_player.rest_plus
layout: vertical
name: Johnny's Hatch
secondary_info: '{sound}' # Only show the name of the current sound
```

### "All-in-One" Control Center

This example exposes all major controls (brightness, sound, timer, and volume presets) behind an expand button for a powerful, all-in-one interface. The background color dynamically fills based on the volume level.

<img width="400" alt="'All-in-One' Control Center" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfeb4e8a-694d-40c0-96b5-d8cf61fcce37" />

```yaml
type: custom:hatch-card
light_entity: light.rest_plus
media_player_entity: media_player.rest_plus
name: Johnny's Hatch
background_mode: volume
secondary_info: 'Sound: {sound} ‚Ä¢ Brightness: {brightness}%'
show_expand_button: true
show_brightness_control: true
show_sound_control: true
show_timer: true
volume_presets: [0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```

### Minimalist Nightstand Control

Perfect for a phone dashboard or small tablet. This compact vertical card uses scenes for the two most common states: 'White Noise' and 'Off'. The main icon still allows you to toggle the last state on and off, and volume controls are always visible for quick adjustments.

<img width="400" alt="'Minimalist Nightstand Control' Control Center" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/102f6460-e555-4429-afd8-b76d4f89f930" />

```yaml
type: custom:hatch-card
light_entity: light.dean_s_hatch_light
media_player_entity: media_player.dean_s_hatch_media_player
name: Johnny's Hatch
show_expand_button: true
show_scenes: true
show_brightness_control: true
show_sound_control: true
scenes_per_row: 3
scenes:
¬† - name: Reading
¬† ¬† icon: mdi:book-open-page-variant
¬† ¬† brightness: 40
¬† ¬† turn_off_media: true
¬† ¬† color: white
¬† - name: Sleep
¬† ¬† icon: mdi:weather-night

¬† - name: "Off"
¬† ¬† icon: mdi:power-off
¬† ¬† turn_off_light: true
¬† ¬† turn_off_media: true
```

## Actions

The card fully supports standard Home Assistant [actions](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/actions/) for `tap_action`, `hold_action`, and `double_tap_action`. This allows you to call services, navigate, or show more info.

**Example:** Change the light to green on a long press.

```yaml
type: custom:hatch-card
light_entity: light.rest_plus
media_player_entity: media_player.rest_plus
hold_action:
  action: call-service
  service: light.turn_on
  target:
    entity_id: light # Special target 'light' refers to the card's light_entity
  data:
    color_name: green
```
